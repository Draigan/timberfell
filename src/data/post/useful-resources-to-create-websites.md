When you hire Timberfell, we bring cranes, rigging, and ISA-certified expertise. Between our visits, homeowners can play a huge role in keeping trees healthy and identifying issues early. These are the resources we recommend every client keep within reach.

## Hand tools that make a difference

- **Bypass hand pruners:** Perfect for removing small suckers or crossing shoots before they become larger structural problems. Choose a sharpenable pair with a safety latch.
- **Pole saw or pruner:** A lightweight, extendable pole lets you reach low-hanging branches safely from the ground. Never overextend—anything beyond shoulder height should wait for a pro.
- **Soil knife or trowel:** Useful for checking mulch depth, aerating compacted root zones, and inspecting girdling roots.
- **Heavy-duty rake:** After a storm, a sturdy rake clears debris so you can spot hanging limbs or trunk damage quickly.

## Digital resources we trust

- **Local weather and storm alerts:** Apps like WeatherCAN help you prepare trees for heavy winds or ice, reducing surprise failures.
- **Tree identification apps:** Tools such as Seek or LeafSnap confirm species so you can look up specific pruning windows or pest pressures.
- **Notebook or shared photo album:** Documenting seasonal changes in bark, leaves, and canopy density helps your arborist spot trends faster.

## Soil and watering care

Healthy roots create resilient trees. Keep these supplies handy:

- Moisture meter for checking whether newly planted trees need a deep soak
- A 2-inch layer of arborist chips or composted mulch to regulate temperature and retain moisture
- Slow-release, tree-safe fertilizer spikes if a soil test shows nutrient deficiencies

Apply water slowly at the drip line rather than the trunk, and always keep mulch pulled back a few inches to prevent rot.

## Know when to call the arborist

DIY care has limits. Reach out to Timberfell for support when you notice:

- Cracks, cavities, or mushrooms forming at the base of a trunk
- Branches resting on service lines, roofs, or sheds
- Emerald ash borer, spongy moth, or other pests common in the Kawarthas
- Storm damage that reveals internal decay

Our crews can inspect the tree, craft a pruning or removal plan, and keep the area secure while work is scheduled.

## Build a long-term partnership

Combine these simple tools with professional inspections every 12–24 months, and your trees will reward you with shade, privacy, and curb appeal. Timberfell is always a phone call away when the job requires climbing gear, aerial lifts, or plant health treatments. Together we can keep your property thriving from canopy to root.
