Tree work demands more than a chainsaw and a ladder. The right arborist protects your property, keeps crews safe, and leaves your landscape better than they found it. Use this checklist to compare providers before you sign a proposal.

## Confirm qualifications and insurance

- **ISA certification:** Look for proof that the lead arborist is certified by the International Society of Arboriculture. It signals training in pruning standards, pest diagnosis, and safety protocols.
- **WSIB and liability coverage:** Request certificates that show active Workplace Safety and Insurance Board coverage plus at least $2 million in liability insurance. This shields you if an accident occurs.
- **Municipal licensing:** Many Kawartha Lakes townships require permits for removals over a certain diameter. A reputable company guides you through the paperwork.

## Evaluate the consultation

Site visits should feel collaborative. A professional arborist will:

1. Walk the property with you and listen to your concerns
2. Explain the condition of each tree in plain language
3. Offer multiple options when removals are not the only solution
4. Provide timelines for seasonal constraints, like nesting birds or freeze-up

If a contractor skips the walk-through or pushes a one-size-fits-all solution, keep looking.

## Assess equipment and safety culture

Ask what equipment the crew plans to use. Bucket trucks, cranes, and rigging systems show they are prepared for complex dismantles. Look for details about:

- Personal protective equipment: helmets, eye protection, and chainsaw pants are non-negotiable
- Property protection: ground mats, rigging plans, and cleanup commitments
- Communication: who will be your on-site contact during the job

## Review the proposal closely

Transparent quotes break down each task, show disposal methods, and outline payment schedules. Clarify whether stump grinding, wood removal, or permit fees are included. At Timberfell, we itemize everything so you can prioritize urgent work and plan for future pruning cycles.

## Look for signs of a long-term partner

Great arborists care about more than a single visit. They provide aftercare instructions, schedule follow-ups, and help monitor emerging pests. Choose a company that shares seasonal reminders, answers questions promptly, and treats your property with respect.

With a trusted partner beside you, every pruning cut and removal serves a purpose. Timberfellâ€™s ISA-certified team is ready to demonstrate the difference professionalism makes.
