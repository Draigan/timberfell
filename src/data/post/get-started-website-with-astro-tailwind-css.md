Before Timberfell ever starts a saw, we make sure you have a clear plan for the trees on your property. A thoughtful first conversation, a thorough site visit, and an actionable quote help you feel confident about the investment you are making. Here is how to get ready and what to expect.

## Walk your property with purpose

Start with a quick walk-through of your yard to take note of the trees that most concern you. Look for the issues below and gather a few photos if possible.

- Cracks, cavities, or mushrooms at the base of the trunk
- Limbs that hang over the house, driveway, or power lines
- Deadwood in the canopy that could fall during wind or ice
- Roots lifting patios, driveways, or septic infrastructure

This overview gives your arborist context before they arrive and ensures nothing is missed when you are reviewing priorities together.

## Share how the space is used

An effective tree care plan considers the people, pets, and projects the yard supports. During your initial call, let us know how you use the property today and what you would like it to do for you in the future. Examples include creating filtered shade for a deck, opening sun for a new garden, or protecting a children's play area.

Understanding the way you live outdoors helps your Timberfell arborist recommend pruning strategies, selective removals, or long-term growth plans that match your lifestyle.

## Expect a detailed site visit

When our ISA-certified arborist meets you on site, they will:

1. Inspect each tree from root flare to canopy, noting structure, vigor, and defects.
2. Evaluate site conditions such as soil compaction, drainage, and access for equipment.
3. Discuss timing concerns, from seasonal nesting protections to municipal permit windows.
4. Prioritize the work based on risk and the outcomes you value most.

Feel free to ask questions about pruning techniques, cleanup expectations, or how we protect surrounding landscapes. Transparency is the best way to build trust.

## Receive a clear and actionable quote

Following the visit you will receive a written quote that outlines each recommended task, the equipment required, and the projected schedule. Timberfell quotes include:

- Scope descriptions written in plain language
- Risk mitigation notes (for example, crane lifts or sectional dismantles)
- Cleanup and debris handling details
- Optional ongoing care, such as structural pruning cycles or plant health treatments

Review the plan, choose the options you want to move forward with, and we will lock in a service date that fits your calendar.

## Build a seasonal maintenance roadmap

Tree care is most effective when it is proactive. Once immediate concerns are addressed, Timberfell can help you map out annual or semi-annual visits for pruning, soil health, and storm-readiness. Staying ahead of structural issues keeps your property safer, protects surrounding plantings, and usually saves money compared with emergency calls.
