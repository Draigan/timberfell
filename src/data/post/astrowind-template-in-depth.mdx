Owning mature trees adds beauty and value to your property, but it also comes with responsibility. Timberfell’s tree risk assessments give you a clear picture of each tree’s structural integrity, health, and long-term prospects. Here is how our process unfolds from the moment we step onto your site.

## 1. Start with questions and history

We begin by listening. Knowing when the tree was planted, how the property drains, or whether fill was added around the trunk helps us interpret what we see. We also ask about recent construction, storms, or pest outbreaks that might have stressed the canopy.

## 2. Ground-level inspection

Our arborist inspects the root flare, trunk, and surrounding soil. We are looking for girdling roots, fungal fruiting bodies, and changes in soil grade. Using a mallet and probe, we check for hidden cavities or soft spots that could weaken the tree’s base.

> Healthy roots anchor the tree and transport water. When they are compromised, even a solid-looking trunk can fail.

## 3. Trunk and canopy review

Next, we examine stem taper, bark condition, and branch attachments. Binoculars help us spot deadwood, cracks, or co-dominant leaders in the upper canopy. If visibility is limited, we may recommend an aerial lift inspection to confirm what is happening higher up.

### Tools we rely on

- Resistograph drilling to measure internal decay without removing large sections of wood
- Diameter tape and calipers to track growth and identify areas of compression
- Digital photography to document defects for your records and future monitoring

## 4. Site and target analysis

Risk is never just about the tree—it is about what could be damaged if the tree fails. We map potential targets like homes, play equipment, driveways, and service lines. We also consider prevailing wind direction, prevailing snow load, and soil saturation.

## 5. Recommendations you can act on

Every Timberfell assessment concludes with a written report that prioritizes actions. Recommendations might include:

- Structural pruning to reduce end weight and correct poor branch unions
- Cabling or bracing to support weak crotches while new wood forms
- Soil remediation when compaction or nutrient deficiency is present
- Full removal when failure is likely and mitigation options are limited

We outline timelines, permitting needs, and whether specialized equipment is required. Photos and diagrams accompany the report so you understand exactly what we observed.

## 6. Follow-up and maintenance planning

Trees are living systems. After mitigation work is complete, we propose monitoring intervals based on species, age, and site exposure. Many clients opt for annual inspections so we can make incremental adjustments instead of reacting to emergencies.
